Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Graphics.UI.Port" library is a portable graphical user interface
library for Haskell. It currently supports Windows and GTK. The
Port library is designed to be a *low-level* library that only makes 
the portable C-library available to Haskell. Other Haskell libraries
can use Port to implement a higher level GUI interface in Haskell.

Port is not yet a complete GUI library but it implements a fair amount
of widgets and is probably "complete enough" for most applications.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

     If you want to build Port for Linux you need to have GTK 2.2 
and GNOME 2.2 development packages. The applications built with Port
are dependent from GTK and GNOME shared libraries. 
     If you want to read/write/create images in formats different 
from BMP then you need to have GdiPlus.dll in your search path. 
GdiPlus.dll is part of GDI+ package which is 
available from http://www.microsoft.com for platforms older that 
Windows XP. Windows XP and Windows 2003 comes with GDI+ installed 
by default.


Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

     In Port 1.2 the toolbars for GTK are not supported. The CVS
version of library supports toolbars but uses the new toolbar API
implemented in GTK 2.3. The support will be enabled after 
GTK 2.4 release.
