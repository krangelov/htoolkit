The "Port" package is a low-level, portable Haskell library for writing graphical
user interfaces (GUI's). It is currently implemented for Windows and GTK. Port does
not (yet) cover all aspects of a full fledged GUI but it is fairly complete and
offers probably enough functionality for most applications.

Allthough it is possible to write GUI's directly using this package, the interface
offers no utility functions or abstraction. Other libraries based
on "Port" should offer a more friendly interface for writing GUI's.
